Files in this directory should be dpkg architectures (such as "armhf" or
"arm64"). The contents of these files are rsync filter rules for files within
the kernel's device tree directory (ex: "/usr/lib/linux-image-$(uname -r)/" on
Debian, "/usr/lib/firmware/$(uname -r)/device-tree/" on Ubuntu) to be copied
over to the netboot file share. For full details, see the "FILTER RULES" section
of the rsync manual page, specifically the "INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES"
section.
