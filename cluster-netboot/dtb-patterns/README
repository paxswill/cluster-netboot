Files in this directory should be dpkg architectures (such as "armhf" or
"arm64"). The contents of these files are glob patterns for files within
the kernel's device tree directory (ex: "/usr/lib/linux-image-$(uname -r)/" on
Debian, "/usr/lib/firmware/$(uname -r)/device-tree/" on Ubuntu) to be copied
over to the netboot file share. Two locations are checked,
/etc/cluster-netboot/dtb-patterns followed by
/usr/share/cluster-netboot/dtb-patterns. The first matching filename is used.
